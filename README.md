**ML Notes and roadmap:**
- Switch cloud providers because Colab has file issues(try to fix that first, if unsuccessful, switch)
- Work on image segmentation(could be done in house), or OpenCV/another tensorflow library
- Think about how we can input and recognize, and maybe just work on low level ideas(regardless of how a dish is cooked, say filet mignon or beef and rice, say beef)
